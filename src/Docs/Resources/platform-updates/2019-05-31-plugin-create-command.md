[titleEn]: <>(Added plugin:create command)

We added a `plugin:create` command which creates a plugin skeleton structure inside the `custom/plugins` directory.
The skeleton contains the required implementation of `\Shopware\Core\Framework\Plugin`, the required `composer.json` file and an empty `services.xml` for further service declarations.
