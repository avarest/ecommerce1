[titleEn]: <>(New UI language handling)

The administration changed the former way of switching between ui languages by deleting the button right above the logout
button. To switch to the ui language of your choice, you have to either go to `your profile` near the logout button,
or the `users and permissions` module in the settings. 

In addition, after logging in or changing the language in the before mentioned places the administration will save your
active language in your local storage to provide the language of choice even after you logged out.

First time users with no information in their local storage will get to see the login screen in their browser language
per default.
