[titleEn]: <>(Mailhog)

Besides that you can now reset your password in the administration and actually get an email,
we've added [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to the development stack and Shopware is pre-configured to use it.

You can open the web interface of mailhog on port 8002 at [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002).
